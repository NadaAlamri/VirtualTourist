# VirtualTourist
project from udacity iOS course
this app allows the user to add pins to the map and select a location to view available photo of that location
when the user click on pin the app shows a list of that location images downloaded from flickr
the images saved in coredata to be fetched in the next time the location selected
and a new collection of photo will be downloaded when the user click on new collection
